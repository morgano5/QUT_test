# QUT Technical Test

This solution uses JRS-303 for bean validation, H2 as in-memory database,
and also authenticates the user through the http header "Authorization"
using "Basic" realm, it is a simple authorization
case as it only authenticates one user/password.

To specify user/password, the application must be run with the following system properties:

_username_: __au.edu.qut.user__

_password_: __au.edu.qut.password__ 

Which can be specified using _-Dproperty=value_ in the java command line, or inside
the __application.properties__ file.

JRS-303 annotations are automatically generated by springfox, so although they don't
appear in the regular code, they do in the generated code.

###Update

In the requirements it was not clear that the Object __MockMvc__ should be explicitly
used in the unit tests, I've added an extra test class to test using this object; so
that we have two test classes: one using __RestTemplate__ and the other using __MockMvc__
